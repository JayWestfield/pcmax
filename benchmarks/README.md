## Benchmark Instances

The files `opt-known-instances-*.txt` list all files (without prefixed directory) with a known optimal makespan, together with that makespan.

Each directory contains the considered problem instances as well as a varying set of data and/or scripts used to create these instances. Note that most directories are named according to the main author of the third-party work which the problem instances are based on (as cited in the paper, Section 6.1).
