# Engineering Optimal Parallel Task Scheduling

This is a *preliminary* online resource for our conference submission. It features the anonymized code (`src/`), our benchmark suite (`benchmarks/`), and our experimental results (`results/`). For the final version, where anonymity is no longer required, we intend to include instructions on how to reproduce all experiments.

## License

We permit reviewers to use, analyze, modify, build, and execute (as applicable) the included resources for the sake of reviewing our work.
Upon publishing, we intend to MIT-license our code and CC-license our benchmark set.
